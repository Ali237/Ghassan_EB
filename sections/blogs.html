    <h3>A case for trying Test-Driven Development as an Embedded Engineer</h3>

    <div class="post-content">
      <p>
        This blog post is a written version of a conversation I've had a few (or
        maybe more than a few ðŸ˜Š) times. As an embedded software developer, I am
        always looking for ways to make development easier, faster, and more
        efficient. One of the best improvements I've made to the quality of my
        software was adopting Test-Driven Development.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll dive a little into what it is and how it may help you as an
        embedded engineer, but for now, I'll leave you with a hook - What if you
        could develop software for hardware without ever pulling out the
        debugger? Without needing the target device to test? And with some
        practice, produce cleaner code faster while shipping with confidence?

    <h3>Checklist for Exchange (TU Delft Style)</h3>

    <div class="post-content">
      <p>
        Preparing for an exchange semester at TU Delft? As an embedded
        engineering student who's been through the process, I've compiled a
        comprehensive checklist to help you prepare. From course selection to
        housing arrangements, this guide covers everything you need to know for
        a successful exchange experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll walk you through the MTE 351 course requirements, how to navigate
        the study guide, and tips for making the most of your time at one of
        Europe's top technical universities.
